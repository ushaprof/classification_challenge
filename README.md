# classification_challenge

## This challenge involves creating and comparing two models on a set of spam data: a Logistic Regression, and a Random Forests Classifier. 

## A prediction is made that the Random Forests Classifier model will perform better than the Logistical Regression Model for the Spam data set.  This is because the RFC model uses trees to predict outcomes, whereas LR model uses linear clssification for its predictions.  Spam is more amenable to trees level classfiication than linear classification.  Hence RFC model is predicted to be better.

## The spam data set is analyzed per classification_challenge criteria.

# The accuracy of the Random Forest Classifier model is 0.9572773352643013

# The accuracy of the Logistic Regression model is 0.9232440260680667

# The Random Forest Classifier model has a higher accuracy than the Logistic Regression model.

# The Random Forest Classifier model is the best model for this dataset.

# The performance of the RFC model compares favorably with the prediction that spam dataset analysis is likely to be more accurate with a decision trees level analysis than a linear data level analysis.
